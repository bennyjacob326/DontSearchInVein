# DontSearchInVein
YU Hackathon 2022 project. Prototype of automated vein finder and IV inserter.

At the end of the hackathon we had python code for finding drawn lines on paper to represent veins, and basic code for moving the machine, human controlled.
The java file expects to be within the FTC control system app, which I didn't include in this repository.
