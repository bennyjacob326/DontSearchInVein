# DontSearchInVein
1st place YU Hackathon 2022 project. Prototype of automated vein finder and IV inserter.

At the end of the hackathon we had python code for finding drawn lines on paper to represent veins using a webcam,
and basic code for moving the machine but human controlled.
The java file expects to be within the FTC control system app, which I didn't include in this repository.
